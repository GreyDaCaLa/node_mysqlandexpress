First follow direction from lecture doc to ge things working and started its pretty much a walk through


Exercise

We walked through connecting a mysql database to our express application. But we stopped at allEmployees and oneEmployee. 

Finish creating endpoints and responses for addEmployee, updateEmployee, and removeEmployee queries

Create a new file named ‘products.js’ inside of your ‘/db/queries’ subfolder, and create CRUD functions that use the Query model we made to write queries to our database on the products table

You will need to create api endpoints for these responses as well

Something along these lines of “/api/products…” will do the trick
